  "summary": "Aryna Siarhiejeŭna Sabalenka (born 5 May 1998) is a Belarusian professional tennis player. She is currently the world No. 1 in women's singles by the WTA, and is a former world No. 1 in doubles. Sabalenka has won 21 WTA Tour-level singles titles, including four majors – two at the Australian Open and two at the US Open – as well as nine WTA 1000 events. She has also won six doubles titles, including the 2019 US Open and 2021 Australian Open, both partnering with Elise Mertens.\nSabalenka came to prominence in 2017 when, together with Aliaksandra Sasnovich, she led the Belarus Fed Cup team to a runner-up finish even though both were ranked outside the top 75 at the time. She finished 2018 and 2019 ranked No. 11 in the world in singles. Following two major singles semifinal appearances in 2021, Sabalenka rose to the world No. 2 ranking but struggled to maintain that success in 2022 consistently. In 2023, she won her first major singles title at the Australian Open and obtained the world No. 1 ranking, being named the ITF World Champion for the season. \nSabalenka successfully defended her Australian Open title and won the US Open the following year, clinching the year-end No. 1 ranking. In 2025, she defended her title at the US Open, and finished as the runner-up at the Australian and French Opens.\nSabalenka began playing doubles regularly in 2019. With Mertens as her partner, she found instant success by winning the Sunshine Double (Indian Wells and Miami) that same year. After the US Open doubles title later in the season, she qualified for the WTA Finals for the first time. With the 2021 Australian Open doubles title, Sabalenka became the world No. 1 in the discipline, after which she shifted to playing exclusively singles.\n\nSabalenka has an aggressive style of play, often accumulating high numbers of winners and unforced errors. With her height, she also displays powerful serves."
